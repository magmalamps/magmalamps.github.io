    <h2>Who has invented it?</h2>
    <p>
        Edward Craven Walker hast invented the first lava lamp ever in
        1963. He was the founder of a company called
        "Mathmos" and they sell lighting products such as the lava lamp
        which was then called "Astrolamp".
    </p>

    <h2>What is about the History?</h2>
    <p>Edward had the idea of a lava lamp while watching a homemade egg timer.
        The egg timer was filled up with liquids while it was bubbeling on a 
        stovetop. After a while Edward had hired a British inventor with the name
        of David George Smith to create the first prototype.
    </p>

    <h2>What was in 1965?</h2>
    <p>
        In 1965 a man with the name of Adolph Wertheimer was very fascinated by the
        prototype shown in a German trade show. He bought all the rights and started
        the Lava Manufacturing Corporation in Chicago. The rights
        were sold to Larry Haggerty later in the 1970s and he created a new
        company named "Lava World International" which produced lava lamps for
        30 years.
