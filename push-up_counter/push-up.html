    <h1>Push-Up Counter</h1>
    <p>Count all the push-ups you can do!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>Click the start button down below and put your phone to the floor,
        where you want to do your push-ups. Now you just need to touch the
        screen with your nose everytime you are in the bottom position of your
        push-up. Happy exercising!
